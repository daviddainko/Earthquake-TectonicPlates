# Earthquake-TectonicPlates
Using earthquake data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed, this repository generates an interactive map that, using Leaflet, organizes, structures, and visualizes the data onto a global map.
The map charts each earthquake based on the provided latitude and longitude and scales/colors each based on the intensity of said earthquake.
